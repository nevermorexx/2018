FTD project
=============================
# Roadmap
It is said that people fail a couple of projects before they finally succeed. I am creating this project to give myself a plan and guidance toward my goal.

I set this project as public, everyone is welcome to share any thoughts.

basic road map
* **2018-2020**(age 26-28 2 years) Learn diffent industrial-level technologies. Including web, back-end, iOS, machine learning, etc. Do some proof of concept through some simple/small size projects.
* **2020-2024**(age 28-32 4 years) Have a systematic view of tech stacks. Qualified to be a senior software engineer. Start to rolling out some commersial-level projects to see where it goes.
* **2024-2032** (age 32-40 8 years) Have a successful commersial project launching. Earning adequate money for family.
* **2032-forward** (age 40+) Make dream projects come true regardless of profits. Mainly use technology to help others and make a real contribution to part of this society.

## Some Project plans(to be growing & updated gradually)
#### House rent for Chinese in US
* Motivation

The two largest house renting websites in US are Craigslist and Zillow. For Chinese people they mainly rely on weChat and school forums to post/find house information. There are many small web sites exiting to provide these kind of information, but none of them is well known and dominant.
* Basic analysis
    1. Need to understand what people truely need for this. Find out the most user-friendly process to seek information
    1. Need to understand why most existing web sites failed to cater people's need.
    1. Need to find a long-lasting proper commercial mode

#### Chinese localized airbnb
* Motivation

Even though as of date 08/06/2018, Airbnb has expanded its business to tens of countries with potential market cap of hundreds of billion US dollars, only small amount of Chinese people have heard of this company. Entering a Chinese market relating to real estate industry is never an easy thing. There is huge potencial in this field.

* Basic analysis
    1. Where to start: I rode a bike from Chengdu to Tibet in 2015. In many remote rural areas, the farmers share their rooms to visitors, the revenue of this service is much higher compared to that they do in agriculture. And in Tibet I had a good experience living in a local beautiful house with cheap price, eating authentic domestic food. Instead of starting in Tier-1 cities like Beijing or Shanghai, which requires huge amount of money and involves fierce competetion, personally it is better to start with smaller cities and see how it goes.
    1. Commercial mode: How to help local people gain extra income while providing good and cheat service to custormer, meanwhile make good revenue from this is a huge task.
    1. Policy obstacle: Need to deal with local governments to get service approved. Need to think ahead of time for lots of managing issues like how to prevent bad guys from using this platform like potential sexual harassment from house owner. Need to be really careful avoiding legal issues.
    
#### Formal but not too formal dating platform
* Motivation

I got this idea from my sister. In China lots of girls are urged to get into a formal relationship and get married right after college graduation (Not know why:mask:). Some exisiting dating apps such as Tantan, are too casual for taking that into a serious relationship stage. While some other platforms like Baihe, Zhenai, are just too formal, which are not found by young people. With so many dating apps existing, I firmly believe this field still has huge potensial. If a reliable and user-friendly platform is made to young people, this would be meaningful:bowtie:

* Basic analysis
    1. Personally I believe for the next generation dating platform, AI technology will play a huge part in this game. With smarter algorithm, people can get matched with more suitable people rather than randomly selected from the mass crowd. And part of my will is to leverage the platform to teach young boys how to respect girls, talk wisely, be a gemtle and have a better dating experience.
    1. This project could be fun:wink: In mid stage need a lot of money to do the marketing
    
#### Education
* Motivation
This is my ultimate goal of my life to improve the education experience for Chinese students. Even being a top student since small, when I look back on the path, the overall learning curve is a little bit unpleasant. With very limited education resource, we need to face the fact that only really small amount of people can receive the top-notch education resources. So the problem goes to improve the education quality for dirrent tiers of students, which in turn, requires different teaching methodology.

All current major private education institutions like 新东方(New oriental) aim at middle class students. The reason is simple: huge number of students and massive commercial potential.

My pitch of education, is not just to imrove the scores, but to really education young kids/people through different social classes.

* On my way to Tibet, in remote areas, children from poor families drop out of school. I spent lots of time thinking about the cause of poverty and how to improve that. Then I realised this has been an unsolved problem throughtout the whole world, thought by numerous people who are much smarter than me. The temporary way to improve this is to go through charities. This field always need money to set up schools and hire teachers. Everything is relating to money. So even if I made a better platform get more people involved in charity would be rewarding and meaningful for my life.

* Again, being an engineer, we solve problems by doing it rather thank talking. My idea is that, in order to education kids, educate teachers first. Nowadays massive information is free and easy to get. With better technology, like AI assistant, to help teachers learn how/what to teach, and to improve the teaching quality. So in some remote areas where there are not enough teachers, one teacher can teach more classes in a more efficient way.

* For most students from cities, the cost to attend after-class private lessons has become more and more expensive, and constitude a noticable proportion of the family expense. We should learn from websites like Coursera to provide high quality, free/low cost classes to students. I know NetEase is working on it right now. But there is really a lot of things remaining to be done.

* For advanced education, namely university education, this topic is too huge to talk about. When I was in freshamn year in college, I read about Kaifu Lee's autobiography, mentioned that he dreamed about creating a top-notch university where young people can be inspired and become real talents for the country, just like the old days in Tsinghua/Beijing University. Unfortunately this requires huge amount of money, lots of top professors from different industry, and lots of policy obstacles, his dream didn't come true. I don't think I can achieve this neither, not even a slight possibility. I put it here just to remind myself what I can do to make a slight contribution, or maybe rethink about it 10 years later.
