FTD project

# Roadmap
It is said that people fail a couple of projects before they finally succeed. I am creating this project to give myself a plan and guidance toward my goal.

I set this project as public, everyone is welcome to share any thoughts.
## Project plans
#### House rent for Chinese in US
#### Formal but not too formal dating platform
#### Education

Blockquotes
As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.

Inline code
I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```

- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax <b>required</b> (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
